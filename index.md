## [](#header-2)Hello!
I am **Rahul Pandey**, first term PhD student in Information Technology with the concentration in Information Science and Technology. I have done my bachelors with _Computer Science_ major from **The LNMIIT**, Jaipur, IN from _2013-17_. My research interests lie in the _intersection_ of _Machine Learning_ and _Semantic understandings of intents and behaviors_ and apply that across domains to solve complex human-centered problems. It is an amalgam of _Social Computing, Intent Mining, Web Mining and Behavior Modeling_ across different modalities including but not limited to _text, images, videos_ etc.   

Currently, I am a Graduate Research Assistant at [Humanitarian, Semantics & Informatics Lab](http://ist.gmu.edu/~hpurohit/informatics-lab.html){:target="_blank"}, [Volgenau School of Engineering](https://volgenau.gmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} in [George Mason University](https://www2.gmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My advisor is [Dr Hemant Purohit](http://ist.gmu.edu/~hpurohit/){:target="_blank"}.

### [](#header-3)Current Projects

def projects(project_no=1):
  project_1 = "Distributional Semantics Approach to Detect Intent in Twitter Conversations on Sexual Assaults"
  project_abstract = "The recent surge in women reporting sexual assault and harassment (e.g., #metoo campaign) has highlighted a longstanding societal crisis. The injustice is partly due to a culture of discrediting women who report such crimes and also, rape myths (e.g., ‘women lie about rape’). Social web can facilitate the further proliferation of deceptive beliefs and culture of rape myths through intentional messaging by malicious actors. This paper investigates Twitter conversations regarding sexual assaults and rape myths for better understanding the context of malicious intent to inform the gender policy and law experts on public beliefs. Specifically, we first propose a novel malicious intent typology for social media using the guidance of social construction theory as Accusational, Validational, or Sensational. We then present and evaluate an intent classification model for Twitter posts using semantic feature representation of the intent senses learned with the help of convolutional neural networks. Lastly, we analyze the narrative contexts in which different malicious intent regarding rape myths are expressed and discuss their implications for policy design."
